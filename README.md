Modernizing Paul Betts ModernHttpClient
================

Available on NuGet: https://www.nuget.org/packages/modernhttpclient-updated/ [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/modernhttpclient-updated.svg?label=NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/modernhttpclient-updated/)

This library brings the latest platform-specific networking libraries to
Xamarin applications via a custom HttpClient handler. Write your app using
System.Net.Http, but drop this library in and it will go securely faster.

This is made possible by:

* On iOS, [NSURLSession](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSURLSession_class/Introduction/Introduction.html)
* On Android, via [OkHttp3](http://square.github.io/okhttp/)
* On UWP, via a custom HttpClientHandler.

## How can I use this from shared code?

Just reference ModernHttpClient in your .Net Standard or Portable Library, and it will use the correct version on all platforms.

## What's new?

This release is focused on security so, the original code has been refactored, removing deprecated APIs to meet the new standards.

Support for untrusted certificates has been removed. Using untrusted certificates is considered a security flaw.

You can get a valid SSL certificate for free from one of these certificate authorities:

https://www.sslforfree.com

https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/

https://ssl.comodo.com/free-ssl-certificate.php

TLS 1.2 has been enforced.

Read why here:

https://www.brillianceweb.com/resources/answers-to-7-common-questions-about-upgrading-to-tls-1.2/

Really "modernizing" the way ModernHttpClient pin server certificates and adding support for client certificates (Mutual TLS Authentication).

As a result, minimumSSLProtocol static property has been removed from iOS, verifyHostnameCallback and customTrustManager static properties has been removed from Android.

## Usage

The good news is, you don't have to know either of these libraries above.

Here's how it works:

```cs
readonly static HttpClient client = new HttpClient(new NativeMessageHandler(false, new CustomSSLVerification()
{
    Pins = new List<Pin>()
    {
        new Pin()
        {
            Hostname = "reqres.in",
            PublicKeys = new []
            {
                "sha256/CZEvkurQ3diX6pndH4Z5/dUNzK1Gm6+n8Hdx/DQgjO0=",
                "sha256/x9SZw6TwIqfmvrLZ/kz1o0Ossjmn728BnBKpUFqGNVM=",
                "sha256/58qRu/uxh4gFezqAcERupSkRYBlBAvfcw7mEjGPLnNU="
            }
        }
    },
    ClientCertificate = new ClientCertificate()
    {
        Passphrase = "PFX_PASSPHRASE",
        RawData = "PFX_DATA"
    }
})
{
    DisableCaching = true,
    Timeout = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 9)
});
```

### How to use NativeCookieHandler?

SetCookie before making the http call and they will be added to Cookie header in the native client:

```cs
NativeCookieHandler cookieHandler = new NativeCookieHandler();

readonly static HttpClient client = new HttpClient(new NativeMessageHandler(false, new CustomSSLVerification()
{
    Pins = new List<Pin>()
    {
        new Pin()
        {
            Hostname = "reqres.in",
            PublicKeys = new []
            {
                "sha256/CZEvkurQ3diX6pndH4Z5/dUNzK1Gm6+n8Hdx/DQgjO0=",
                "sha256/x9SZw6TwIqfmvrLZ/kz1o0Ossjmn728BnBKpUFqGNVM=",
                "sha256/58qRu/uxh4gFezqAcERupSkRYBlBAvfcw7mEjGPLnNU="
            }
        }
    },
    ClientCertificate = new ClientCertificate()
    {
        Passphrase = "PFX_PASSPHRASE",
        RawData = "PFX_DATA"
    }
}, cookieHandler)
{
    DisableCaching = true,
    Timeout = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 9)
});

var cookie = new Cookie("cookie1", "value1", "/", "reqres.in");
cookieHandler.SetCookie(cookie);

var response = await client.GetAsync(new Uri("https://reqres.in"));
```

## NativeCookieHandler methods

```SetCookies(IEnumerable<Cookie> cookies)```: set native cookies

```DeleteCookies()```: delete all native cookies.

```SetCookie(Cookie cookie)```: set a native cookie.

```DeleteCookie(Cookie cookie)```: delete a native cookie.
